          well as the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act,

          We collect and analyze data and present evaluation results in an
          understandable manner that can be used by stake holders to implement a
          program or to make changes that will improve the status quo of the
          client and the public. We also conduct case studies. We have conducted
          evaluations for HUD, and SBA.
